# About-me
 Hello, I am an electrical and electronics engineer in TÃ¼rkiye. 
I am not working at the moment. I am learning new programs. I am following new developments.
I like skiing in the city I live in. I give private lessons to a student in math and #English. I have my own account where I make butterfly bouquets. I sell butterfly bouquets to florists.
I love traveling from city to city. I believe that the best way to visit a place is by walking. I am a hardworking and determined person.
I hope you will see my projects here as I improve myself.
